## Virtual Network
Creates a new virtual network.

An Azure virtual network (VNet) is a representation of your own network in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription. You can fully control the IP address blocks, DNS settings, security policies, and route tables within this network. You can also connect Virtual Networks to your on-premises network. See [Virtual Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview).
