## Subnet
Creates a new subnet. Subnets represent network segments within the IP space defined by the virtual network.

Subnets represent network segments within the IP space defined by the virtual network. Subnets are child resources of a virtual network. Subnets have names unique within a VNET and they can be addressed via URIs.

### Example
```hcl
module "subnet" {
  source               = "git::ssh://git@github.com/mobilabsolutions/terraform-modules.git?ref=1.0.0//modules/azurerm/network/subnet"
  resource_group_name  = "${module.resource_group.name}"
  virtual_network_name = "${module.virtual_network.name}"
  subnets              = "${var.subnets}"
}
```
