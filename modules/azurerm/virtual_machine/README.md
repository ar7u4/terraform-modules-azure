## Virtual Machine
Create one or more virtual machine(s).

Microsoft Azure supports running a number of popular Linux distributions provided and maintained by a number of partners. You will find distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, CoreOS, RancherOS, FreeBSD, and more in the Azure Marketplace. We actively work with various Linux communities to add even more flavors to the [Azure endorsed Linux Distros](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) list.

When you deploy a VM in Azure, you are going to select a VM size within one of our series of sizes that is suitable to your workload. The size also affects the processing power, memory, and storage capacity of the virtual machine. You are billed based on the amount of time the VM is running and consuming its allocated resources. A complete list of [sizes of Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

subnet_cidr | Required) CIDR of the Subnet for the network interface. | string
private_ip_address_allocation | (Optional) IP assignment for the network interface. Can be static or dynamic: if using static please set private_ip_address. | string
private_ip_addresses | (Optional) Private IP address for the network interface. Required if private_ip_address_allocation is static. | list
network_security_group_id | (Optional) Network security group id to attach to instance. | string
