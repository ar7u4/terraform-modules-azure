## Storage Account

module "storage_account" {
  source              = "git::ssh://git@github.com/mobilabsolutions/terraform-modules.git?ref=master//modules/azurerm/storage/account"
  account_name        = "${var.name}"
  location            = "${var.location}"
  resource_group_name = "${var.resource_group_name}"
  tags                = "${var.tags}"
}
