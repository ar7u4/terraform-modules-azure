## Storage Container

An Azure storage account provides a unique namespace to store and access your Azure Storage data objects. A general-purpose storage account gives you access to Azure Storage services such as Tables, Queues, Files, Blobs and Azure virtual machine disks under a single account.

```hcl
module "storage_container" {
  source               = "git::ssh://git@github.com/mobilabsolutions/terraform-modules.git?ref=1.1.0//modules/azurerm/storage/container"
  name                 = "${var.name}"
  storage_account_name = "${var.storage_account_name}"
  resource_group_name  = "${var.resource_group_name}"
}
```
