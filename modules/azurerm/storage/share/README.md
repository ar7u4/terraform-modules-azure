## Storage Share
Create an Azure Storage Share.

File Storage offers shared storage for legacy applications using the standard SMB protocol. Azure virtual machines and cloud services can share file data across application components via mounted shares, and on-premises applications can access file data in a share via the File service REST API.

### Example
```hcl
module "storage_share" {
  source               = "git::ssh://git@github.com/mobilabsolutions/terraform-modules.git?ref=1.0.0//modules/azurerm/storage/share"
  name                 = "${var.name}"
  resource_group_name  = "${var.resource_group_name}"
  storage_account_name = "${var.storage_account_name}"
}
```
