## Environment
Create a Rancher Environment resource.

Rancher supports grouping resources into multiple environments. Each environment starts with a set of infrastructure services defined by the environment template used to create the environment. Each environment has its own set of resources, and is owned by one or more users or groups.

All hosts and any Rancher resources, such as containers, infrastructure services, and so on are created in and belong to an environment.

### Example
```hcl
module rancher_environment {
  source        = "github.com/mobilabsolutions/terraform-modules.git?ref=1.1.0//modules/rancher/environment"
  name          = "${var.name}"
  orchestration = "${var.orchestration}"
}
```
