## Secret
Creates a Rancher Secret resource.

Rancher has introduced the ability to create named secrets to be used in containers. Secrets are created and scoped at an environment level, which means there can only be one secret with the same name in an environment. Any container in the same environment can share the same secrets. For example, a database password, i.e. db_password, can be used in a database container and a Wordpress container. Once a secret is created, the secret value cannot be edited or updated. If you need to change an existing value of a secret, the only way to do so is to delete the secret. After a secret has been updated, any services using the secret will need to be re-launched with the updated secret.

### Example
```hcl
module "rancher_secret" {
  source         = "git::ssh://git@github.com/mobilabsolutions/terraform-modules.git?ref=master//modules/rancher/secret"
  name           = "${var.name}-db-pw"
  description    = "${var.name} DB password"
  environment_id = "${var.rancher_environment_id}"
  value          = "${var.database_password}"
}
```
